### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Moussa**, a frontend developer based in Northern France. (I'm still a student)

I like challenging myself with technical knowledge and design to make beautiful, simple, minimalistic, and intuitive applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging and flawless user experiences.
I also like to experiment a lot (because I'm curious üßê). My repositories contain my projects and experiments.

#### Fun Facts:

- I like piano and rain sounds
- My favorite book is Mindset by Dr. Carol S. Dweck
- Outside of coding, I enjoy working out and reading
- My personality type is INTJ
