### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Moussa**, a frontend developer based in Northern France. (I'm still a student)

I like to challenge myself with my technical knowledge and design to make beautiful, simple, minimalistic, and intuitive applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging and flawless user experiences.
I also like to experiment a lot (cuz I'm curious üßê). You can view my repositories to see my projects and experiments.

#### Fun Facts:

- I like piano and rain sounds
- My favorite book is Mindset by Dr. Carol S. Dweck
- Outside of coding, I enjoy working out and reading
- My personality type is INTJ
